## Problem Statement

Current player tracking systems using multiple cameras face challenges:

* **Inconsistent Player Identification**: Different camera angles lead to inconsistent player recognition.
* **Manual Intervention**: Cross-camera player matching often requires human effort.
* **Lack of Real-time Processing**: Automatic and accurate player matching is difficult in real-time applications.

---

## Our Solution

This project addresses the challenge of **cross-camera player mapping** using a **pretrained Siamese Network**. It enables:

* **Automatic Player Matching**: Identifies and matches players across multiple camera feeds.
* **Real-Time Processing**: Efficiently processes video frames for live applications.
* **High Accuracy**: Achieves high similarity scores in matching players based on appearance.

## How It Works: Step-by-Step

### 1. Video Input ‚Äì Start with Multiple Camera Feeds

You provide two video inputs: one from a **broadcast camera** and the other from a **tacticam**. Both videos contain player interactions in the same game or event.

### 2. Player Detection ‚Äì Detect Players Using YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is used to detect players within the video frames. The bounding boxes are extracted for each detected player in both camera feeds.

### 3. Feature Extraction ‚Äì Extract Visual Features with Siamese Network

Each detected player is cropped out and passed to a **pretrained Siamese Network** for feature extraction. The network generates embeddings that represent the player‚Äôs appearance.

### 4. Player Matching ‚Äì Compare Embeddings with Cosine Similarity

The embeddings of players from both cameras are compared using **cosine similarity**. A higher similarity score means the players are likely the same person, despite coming from different camera angles.

### 5. Optimal Matching ‚Äì Use Hungarian Algorithm for Mapping

The Hungarian algorithm is applied to find the optimal matching of players between the two video feeds based on the similarity scores.

### 6. Output ‚Äì Display Matched Players

The result is a list of player pairs indicating which players in the **broadcast video** correspond to players in the **tacticam video**.
